                        “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all”. These are the words of
                        the
                        Greek philosopher Aristotle. I am proud indeed to say that this is what we at LCVS follow.
                        “Excellence in academics” is our prime concern though sports and games and other extra
                        curricular
                        activities to form an integral part of LCVS. We endeavour to give every child who enters the
                        portal
                        of our school, “a holistic education”. <br>
                        “Success in life comes when you simply refuse to give up, with goals so strong that obstacles,
                        failures and loss only act as Motivation”.
